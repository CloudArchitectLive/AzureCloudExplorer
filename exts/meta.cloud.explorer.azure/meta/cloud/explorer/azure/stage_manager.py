# This class is intended to manage the stage

# Using the requested view and the loaded dataset, we need to translate data into Prims

# There are 2 variables here.  The prims you want to see, and the way you want to see them

# the data gives resource counts by subscription, group, or location.
# it also contains resource group data and data about all the raw resources
# we need to put the resource prims in groups on the stage, floating islands ?

# I want to try and build a floating island for each resource group, IE a plane that prims can rest on.
# The islands will be 2d planes in 3d space, big enough to accomidate the resources in said group.

# the more resources the bigger the island.
#we can then postion the islands in movel ways for exploration
